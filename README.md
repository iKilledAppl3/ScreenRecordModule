# Screen Record Module (Project Addilynne Screen Recorder)
A screen record module (widget) for tvOS. QuickTime who? 
A project that's been one year in the making! Feel free to take a look at the code.
Yes it needs some TLC but it works (on tvOS 14 only for now).
Originally Called "Addilynne Record Module" (named after my niece)
